# Rooms of My Dream House
#### by Tanvi Murugesh

### Overview
This is a simple state machine that goes between 6 (7 states) of a house in a non linear fashion. There is also an element of user interaction though keyboard input and mouse click. 


### How it works
array of images gets loaded at startup

drawFunction is a VARIABLE that points to a function varible name

drawOne(), drawTwo(), etc. are set to be functions.

depending on the current state, the keys, and mouse pressed will change the drawFunction variable

starts with drawOne (living room)

video capture is also an aspect implemented for the bathroom mirror
